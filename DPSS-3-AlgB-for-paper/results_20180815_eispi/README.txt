CE_coord_vbls_not_correct_after_15_steps.xls -- Observer that shows it takes more than 15 steps to achieve correct coordination variables with arbitrary initial conditions.

CE_coord_vbls_not_correct_until_after_3T.xls -- Observer that shows it takes more than 3T to achieve correct coordination variables with arbitrary intitial conditions.

CE_coord_vbls_not_correct_until_after_3T_init_pos_set.xls -- This is the observer/counterexample referenced in the paper titled "When Human Intition Fails: Using Formal Methods to Find an Error in the 'Proof' of a Multi-Agent Protocol." It also shows that it takes more than 3T to achieve correct coordination variables, but here the initial conditions are prescribed.

CE_more_than_3_and_one_fifth_T_for_correct_coord_vbls_but_still_optimal_before_4T.xls -- Observer that shows a case where it takes more than (3 + 1/5)T for the coordinational variables to be correct, but the optimal configuration is still reached before 4T.

CE_nearly_3T_convergence.xls -- An observer that shows a case that takes nearly 3T to reach the optimal configuration.

CE_nearly_4T_convergence.xls -- An observer that shows a case that takes nearly 4T to reach the optimal configuration.

CE_not_optimal_after_19_steps.xls -- An observer that shows it takes more than 19 steps to achieve the optimal configuration with arbitrary initial conditions.
